I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented Phd candidate with fluid collaborative abilities and a keen interest in conceptualizing complex concepts.
I am well-versed with significant quantum algorithms and recent literature in this ever-emerging domain. I have hands-on experience
in working with various quantum platforms and simulators,
specializing in IBM Quantum Services and Qiskit framework for development of interesting quantum applications. I am currently investigating the efficient use of quantum resources in the Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum Device era.
